      <p>For two weeks, June 1744, in Lancaster Pennsylvania, 250 Iroquois people were having a diplomatic conference with representatives from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. The colonies asked for them to trade their land for merchandise. The colonists claimed that the Iroquois would be protected, and that they aren't destroying the land, but instead putting it under new ownership. The Iroquois agreed to the deal to give their land for merchandise, as the colonists weren't going to take no for an answer.</p>
